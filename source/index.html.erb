    <p>Hi, my name is Vladi Angelov, a Bulgarian / British citizen living in Crawley, West Sussex.
    <br><br>
    I have a Master's degree in Geophysics and for nearly 9 years I worked for the largest company in this field - <a class="index-links" href="https://www.cgg.com" target="_blank">CGG</a>. Starting as a junior scientist and becoming a team leader in a few years, I am an expert in data processing, analysis and data science.
    <br><br>
    Although I love geoscience, throughout my career I enjoyed programming the most and in 2019 I took some time to grow my expertise in <strong>Web Development</strong> and <strong>Computer Science</strong>, by taking a 6 month intensive coding bootcamp at Le Wagon, followed by another 6 month Computer Science for Web Development course by Harvard University.
    <br><br>
    Since 2020 I am part of the product team of <a class="index-links" href="https://www.sleepstation.org.uk" target="_blank">Sleepstation</a>, working as a Full Stack Developer. My core tech stack is <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> and <strong>React</strong>, however I do have some experience with <strong>Django</strong> and <strong>Flask</strong> too. I have recently become interested in Functional Programming and <strong>Ramda</strong> too.
    <br><br>
    I am also quite confident with building and using <strong>REST APIs</strong>, have significant experience working with <strong>GraphQL</strong> and years of experience with HTML, CSS/SCSS, SQL, vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap to mention a few.

            <div class="bottom">
                <%= image_tag '/images/skills/html.png', width: 75, height: 75%>
                <p>I have been using HTML since the late 90s - familiar with most of it, however there is so much behind the scenes that I seem to be learning something new almost every day.</p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li class="tooltip list-item">
            CSS / Sass

                <%= image_tag '/images/skills/sass.png', width: 75, height: 75%>
                <p>I have been getting a lot better with CSS during the Le Wagon coding bootcamp. That's where I discovered sass/scss too and I have never gone back to normal css since.</p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li class="tooltip list-item">
            JavaScript (ES6)

                <%= image_tag '/images/skills/js.png', width: 75, height: 75%>
                <p>Mainly experienced with vanilla JS and front-end - selecting DOM elements, adding event listeners, using callback functions, etc. Some very basic experience with Node. Trying to learn React next.</p>

            <div class="bottom">
                <%= image_tag '/images/skills/bootstrap.png', width: 75, height: 75%>
                <p>Not the biggest fan of Bootstrap (prefer my own CSS), however I have still used it on a couple of small projects, where timing was very important.</p>

                <p>I have been using SQL in my work environment, as well as intensively during the coding bootcamp. It a lot more behind the scenes when using ORM (i.e. ActiveRecord), however still important to know for debugging.</p>

                <p>I just started learning React, but already have some basic knowledge - I definitely prefer it over Angular and it is still more popular than Vue.</p>
